In this project I programmed a self driving car (neural network) that you can train to finish a certain obstacle course (road and other cars).
There are 2 differnet versions, one with a straight road and one with a curved road.
On the left side is the car and road, on the right you can see the neural network of the car that is the furthest (best) and in between there is a save and discard button for the next iterations.
In the folders you can find the different steps I took to complete this course.
V1-8 and then the main files have a straight road with multiple cars to avoid
v1_2-8_2 have a curved road and 1 car to avoid
